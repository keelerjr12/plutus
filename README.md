# Plutus

A double-entry accounting and personal finance application written in Python. Think GnuCash, YNAB, and Quicken all rolled into one, but executed from the command line. Those applications never provided me the data and ease-of-use I was looking for, so for the better part of a decade I was using 20+ Excel sheets to track my finances.

As mentioned, I largely enjoy working from the command line and front-end development isn't much of my passion. However, a web API is in the works to be used by a front-facing Angular application. As I largely enjoy backend development, this is where I spend 98+% of the focus with this project.

To run:

`python -m cli COMMAND [OPTIONS]`

This README will be a WIP, but as much of the time is devoted to the application itself, I will add to this when it makes sense.
